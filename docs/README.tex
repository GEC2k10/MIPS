	\section{Introduction}
		This application is a MIPS emulator to be developed completely on C.The development is centred 
		around the efficiency and running time of the code,rather than the ease of implementation.
		All the hardware features like registers and the memory are to be implemented as such by using 
		their standard software counterparts,like integers,characters and floats.The main memory is to 
		be implemented using a 1D array of fixed length.

		\subsection{\bf Coding guidelines:}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item{ Use tabs for intendation,any style }
				\item{ Meaningful variables,preferably without underscores }
				\item{ Reuse memory(variables) wherever possible }
				\item{ Document your code well }
				\item{ If you wish contribute to docs,just upload .tex files only}
			\end{enumerate}
